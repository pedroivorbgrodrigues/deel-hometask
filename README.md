# DEEL BACKEND TASK
  

💫 Welcome! 🎉


This backend exercise involves building a Node.js/Express.js app that will serve a REST API. We imagine you should spend around 3 hours at implement this feature.

## My comments

I didn't do anything extra cause I'm still not fully recovered from COVID and I can't spend too much time on the test, I took beetween 3 to 4 hours acording to github

The reason for changin the sqlite3 version on package json is because I'm using Ubuntu 22 which doesnt comes with pythin 2.7 anylonger and the sqlite3 version 4 had a install problem with python 3

I added the Insomnia file I used to test the endpoints to the project

It has been a long time since I worked with a project that used a ORM so I'm pretty sure that there are better ways to achieve the desired result.

For example I'm not sure I had to check everytime for the profile type to specify the where clause, maybe there is already an mixin or method for it

Same goes for the non terminated contracts, maybe its possible to use association scopes?

I didn't add eslint so some lines has ; other don't, that is one of the reasons I usually set eslint for (code uniformity)

No standard response format was specified for operations realized in the API so I used what I'm used to

The task 5 restriction does not make sense to me, so altought its done I would request to talk to who defined this rule to understand before actually continuing with this task

The endpoints involving date parameters need to be revised to use either a defined timezone or consider the server one (current)

The task 6 and 7 didn't specify if should be only done on the database, and since it's been a while I used an ORM I would probably just do a raw query insted of trying to chain subquerys.

## Data Models

> **All models are defined in src/model.js**

### Profile
A profile can be either a `client` or a `contractor`. 
clients create contracts with contractors. contractor does jobs for clients and get paid.
Each profile has a balance property.

### Contract
A contract between and client and a contractor.
Contracts have 3 statuses, `new`, `in_progress`, `terminated`. contracts are considered active only when in status `in_progress`
Contracts group jobs within them.

### Job
contractor get paid for jobs by clients under a certain contract.

## Getting Set Up

  
The exercise requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed. We recommend using the LTS version.

  

1. Start by cloning this repository.

  

1. In the repo root directory, run `npm install` to gather all dependencies.

  

1. Next, `npm run seed` will seed the local SQLite database. **Warning: This will drop the database if it exists**. The database lives in a local file `database.sqlite3`.

  

1. Then run `npm start` which should start both the server and the React client.

  

❗️ **Make sure you commit all changes to the master branch!**

  
  

## Technical Notes

  

- The server is running with [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) which will automatically restart for you when you modify and save a file.

- The database provider is SQLite, which will store data in a file local to your repository called `database.sqlite3`. The ORM [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/) is on top of it. You should only have to interact with Sequelize - **please spend some time reading sequelize documentation before starting the exercise.**

- To authenticate users use the `getProfile` middleware that is located under src/middleware/getProfile.js. users are authenticated by passing `profile_id` in the request header. after a user is authenticated his profile will be available under `req.profile`. make sure only users that are on the contract can access their contracts.
- The server is running on port 3001.

  

## APIs To Implement 

  

Below is a list of the required API's for the application.

  


1. ***GET*** `/contracts/:id` - This API is broken 😵! it should return the contract only if it belongs to the profile calling. better fix that!

1. ***GET*** `/contracts` - Returns a list of contracts belonging to a user (client or contractor), the list should only contain non terminated contracts.

1. ***GET*** `/jobs/unpaid` -  Get all unpaid jobs for a user (***either*** a client or contractor), for ***active contracts only***.

1. ***POST*** `/jobs/:job_id/pay` - Pay for a job, a client can only pay if his balance >= the amount to pay. The amount should be moved from the client's balance to the contractor balance.

1. ***POST*** `/balances/deposit/:userId` - Deposits money into the the the balance of a client, a client can't deposit more than 25% his total of jobs to pay. (at the deposit moment)

1. ***GET*** `/admin/best-profession?start=<date>&end=<date>` - Returns the profession that earned the most money (sum of jobs paid) for any contactor that worked in the query time range.

1. ***GET*** `/admin/best-clients?start=<date>&end=<date>&limit=<integer>` - returns the clients the paid the most for jobs in the query time period. limit query parameter should be applied, default limit is 2.

    {
        "id": 1,
        "fullName": "Reece Moyer",
        "paid" : 100.3
    },
    {
        "id": 200,
        "fullName": "Debora Martin",
        "paid" : 99
    },
    {
        "id": 22,
        "fullName": "Debora Martin",
        "paid" : 21
    }
]
```

  

## Going Above and Beyond the Requirements

Given the time expectations of this exercise, we don't expect anyone to submit anything super fancy, but if you find yourself with extra time, any extra credit item(s) that showcase your unique strengths would be awesome! 🙌

It would be great for example if you'd write some unit test / simple frontend demostrating calls to your fresh APIs.

  

## Submitting the Assignment

When you have finished the assignment, create a github repository and send us the link.

  

Thank you and good luck! 🙏
